### 📌 **Featured Project: Landmark API**
One of my biggest projects to date is the **Landmark API**. This is a full-fledged RESTful API built in **GoLang**, providing detailed information on landmarks across the world. It’s packed with advanced features like JWT authentication, role-based access control, rate limiting, and even Redis caching for performance optimization. The API supports complex querying, including filtering, pagination, and full-text search, making it a powerful tool for anyone looking to manage or access landmark data.

Feel free to explore the **Landmark API** and other projects! They showcase my journey in mastering GoLang, front-end frameworks like React, and various tools for creating high-performance applications.

Let’s collaborate and build something amazing together! 😊
